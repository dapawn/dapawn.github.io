The day before last was my twelth wedding anniversary. It was twelve years ago that I married the most beautiful woman in the world. I often thank God for bringing us together. My wife calls it a blind date, but I like to think of it as an 'arranged marriage'... by God. She was from Chicago, I was from Philadelphia, and It was our church ministers that said we should meet. And I'm so glad we did, because now I know I've found my perfect mate.

First off, she can put up with me, and that's not the easiest job in the world. When we first got mattied, our home didn't have a kitchen, running water, or electricity on the first floor. The only running water was in the second floor bathroom. But she didn't complain. A couple weeks after returning from our honeymoon, we discovered we were having a baby! A couple days later I got laid off from the engineering job where I had been working for almost ten years. It took almost three months to land the next job, but she never doubted me, instead calling that time a blessing cause we got to spend so much time together.

She is also a wonderful mother, which is important cause we now have a pretty big family with four kids and another one on the way. Her friends call her 'super mom' (which she hates, but its another thing I like about her - she is humble). We have a small three bedroom home, but she is content with our humble home. She says a big house would be too much work to clean.

She is such a hard worker as well, she not only keeps our small home clean and clutter free (which is nigh impossible with a big family and a small home, ), but she always helps clean up and wash the dishes whenever we're hanging out with friends.

She gives me her full support and has confidence in me, even when I'm doubting myself. When I was having trouble finding another engineering job, and I came up with the idea to take our life savings to buy a house and start a house flipping business, she was like, sure, I know you can do it.

There were some hard times with the business, but she stuck with me. The business paid the bills for the next eight years, but not much else. We had to cut back in many area's, make sacrifices, but she didn't complain, and supported  me the whole time.

I love this woman with all my heart, and look forward the next twelve years. Oh...  did I mention she's a great cook!
