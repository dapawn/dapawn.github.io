Our fridge stopped working unexpectedly, throwing an error code. In the old days (10 years ago), that would have ment an expensive repairman visit, or new fridge. But that wasn't an option, as my budget, like many others, was very tight.

Thankfully the knowledge of the ages is right in the palms of our hands (through our smart phones).  You can become a psuedo expert on almost any topic within the hour. It is a wonderful time to be alive and connected to the internet! We have almost limitless possibilities available to us.

With a little research, and a couple videos on YouTube,  I not only had  narrowed down the problem to two parts, but I also knew the step by step process to replace each one. 

Not knowing which part actually was the culprit, I ordered the cheaper one first. Unfortunately, I had to also order the expensive control board, which did the trick and had us back in business. And my budget was able to sleep better that night.

They say knowledge is power. And as Spiderman says, "With power comes great reponsibilty."
