Raising kids can be a lot of work (mine are still young), its no easy task to train them up to be responsible adults, but its definitely worth all the headaches. And sometimes its a real joy, like when you come home after a long day, and they run to meet you at the door and jump on you giving the biggest hug.

Another secret pleasure is when you play with them, you get to be a kid again. I used to love playing with Legos, that was all I wanted for my birthday and Christmas. Space Legos were my thing (Starwars was a big influence). Everyday, before my parents would be out of bed, I would be up quietly building Legos with my brothers. I loved creating new things.

When I felt my son was old enough, I passed on the collection I had amassed over the years,.  Perhaps, that may not have been the best thing, cause when you get something easily, you don't appreciate it as much. But it did give me an excuse to start playing with them again.

I don't know if he enjoys them as much as I did, but he does enjoy playing with them together with me. One of his favorite things is to builld a vehicle that we then take outside to do some imagination play, Like we are exploring a hostile alien world.

I love that he enjoys it, because the truth is, its so nice to escape the routine, stress, and worries of adult life... and just be a kid again.

Here's some pics:
