My family got our first computer back in 1988, if memory serves me correct, it was a Tandy 1000 that my dad had picked up at RadioShack. It had a color monitor which was pretty cool at the time, but no harddrive, or optical drive, just a floppy drive. We turned it on, and after what seemed like a really long time, we were greeted by a DOS command prompt. We all starred at it for a bit... none of us knowing what to do with it. Needless to say we were all underwhelmed by this expensive piece of machinery that seemingly could not do anything.

My dad discovered that it had a simple programming language called BASIC, which was an acronym that stood for Beginner's All-Purpose Symbolic Instruction Code. Half joking, he says, "I guess if we want it to do something, we'll have to program it ourselves." Well, I wanted a game... thus began my foray into programming. 

Some months later I had my first simplistic text based game. I was trying to make a game like Space Invaders, but it just counted the number of alian ships you destroyed, the alian ships stayed at the top of the screen and your ship could move left and right at the bottom and shoot. It looked something like this:

```
[I]      [I]      [I]




          I
         [I]
```

The game wasn't very exciting, but the idea of getting the computer to do something for me, was. Over the years, the ability to get the computer to do stuff for me has saved a lot of time and effort. Computer's have advanced a lot since then, and so have the languages we use to control them. And the ability to program has only become more valuable.
