It seems that active littlekids and laptops, monitors, and TV's are completely incompatible, at least mine are. Last week my kids broke yet another screen, that's at least the 9th screen we have had to replace over the past 10 years with kids. Some of those were on the same device after I had already replaced a broken screen. Oh, and phones don't fare much better, I've had to replace phone screen just about as many times.

Yeah, that starts to adds up to some signifcant cash after about the 5th time. We started buying our Tvs off craigslist, cause the chances of it lasting more than a couple years just aren't very high. Decent laptops and phones are too expensive to replace, so I've been buying just the LCD which usually runs around $100, and phone screens about half that depending on the model. Thanks to wealth of information available on Youtbe mainly, I've been able to replace these myself.

The last screen to break was my son's TV/DVD Combo (We love these for homeschooling, so we have a couple). When we didn't find any cheap ones on Craigslist, I was looking for a quick replacement (The kids were using my laptop, which meant I could not do my school... and there was increased risk that my screen would break!!! )

Raspberry Pi and zip ties to the rescue! Raspberry Pi is a small creditcard sized comuter, I zip tied it to the back of an old computer monitor along with a USB DVD player, and an extention cord so I could wrap up all the other cables to the back and just have a single plug, and 'voila', my very own TV/DVD Player combo. Ok, so its not pretty, but it works for now until a cheap one appears on Craigslist. And now my laptop screen can rest a little easier at night too.

Here are some pics:
