My oldest son justed turned eleven, and I was thinking it was time to get him exposed to some electronics  and programming projects. So I got him a Raspberry Pi electronics project kit, thinking it would be an easy and fun way to stir up his interest.

I often marvel at how quickly my kids adapt to technology, from tablets to phones, it all seems so intuitive to them.  I've been using computers since the 1980's, so I forgot how different things would be for him. I was assuming that he would just absorb it all quickly, like everything else.

I wanted to let him 'sit in the driver seat' ; so once I setup the R-Pi, I let him boot into the desktop... well a basic Linux window manager called Pixel. Its very lightweight and effcient, which you need on the R-Pi, but its no KDE. My son has used Windows, so while a little different and scaled down, he could function. But to do our projects, we would have to head down to the Terminal, the Linux command line that is.. I could almost see fear in his eyes as he starred into the darkness at the blinking light (the cursor}.

I've come to love and admire the Linux/UNIX Command Line. Even with robust and powerful desktop environemnts like KDE, there is incredible power at the command line. You haven't really experienced Linux until you've master the command line, piping the output of one command to the next, writing one-liner scripts, growing to love Vim/Vi. It blows your mind how quick and efficient it allows you to do thing. But I digress.

I gave my son a quick intro to the command line; here's basic filesystem structure, here's how to print the working directory that your in, here's how to list files and directories, here's how to change to a different directory, using the 'tab' key to save yourself some typing...

Typing... its not intuitive. I tell him to switch to our project directory... and there he was single finger searching the the 'c' key, then the 'd' key. 'what's the space bar, daddy?!?' At this point, I begin to realize how overwhelming this must be for him. There is just so  much new here, and we haven't even gotten to programming, let alone building the circuit for the project.

It took patience, but we did get the project built and working, we even made modifications to it, showing the we could control it in different ways. And he wanted to try the next project which we did and it was great. But its been a few months since we've touched it now. He just doesn't have the interest yet. 

I'm going to focus on teaching him typing for now. Then introduce him to basic Python programming. before we get to the Electronics projects with the Raspberry Pi. I wish I had taken it one strp at a time the first time around, I don't think he would have been so overwhelmed.

I just hope it doesn't take too long, because the truth is, I'm really looking forward to these father/son projects even if they are basic, and eventually bulding something really cool together!
