Sure it can be intimidating, staring at a pitch black screen with nothing but a single lone blinking cusor, but there is a great power that lies beneath this dark interface... okay maybe that's a little dramatic, but its true, particular if you have process files or manipulate text. I'm talking about the Linux/UNIX command line of couse.

I learned UNIX at work, and probably because I had a bunch of repetitive changes to make on a ton of files, I grew to love the power that the command line offered. I started to dig deeper into, and every day became like Christmas... some new treat under the tree. How could something so ancient be so elegant and powerful.

The UNIX philosophy is to; *Write programs that do one thing and do it well. Write programs to work together. Write programs to handle text streams, because that is a universal interface.* This has enabled UNIX/Linux to stand the test of time, and be incredibly powerful and efficient, especially how all the commands can be connected together with pipes (text steams). Coming from a DOS/Windows background, this blew my mind away. 

UNIX/Linux has so many simle yet powerful commands available. One  could *find* all the files with a certain prefix, pipe into *grep* with *xargs* for lines that contain a certain phase, and then pipe into *sort -u* to only show unique lines. It's almost magical,  a useful sophisticated program all in a single line command.

Things worth doing are seldom easy, but if you invest some time to learn the basic commands, and play with 'pipes', I'm pretty sure you'll start to feel like a wizard too.
